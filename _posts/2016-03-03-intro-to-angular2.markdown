Angular2 is something I have been using since it first came out in early alpha and recently I ran a lightning introduction to Angular2 session at a work technology conference in London at the Ace Hotel in Shoreditch.

I may write some more in-depth posts around Angular2 at a later date but for now here is the deck from the session, which should give you some idea of what Angular2 is all about.
